      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>Max, creator of CaseCaddy, has had a life threatening allergy to most nuts since the age of 2. For his entire life he has had to be reminded to carry his AuviQ around. CaseCaddy changed that. Welcome to CaseCaddy, where innovation meets lifesaving convenience. Designed in Max's college fresgman dorm room, our journey began with a clear mission: to make carrying an AuviQ not just easier, but a seamless part of daily life. Our founder, recognizing the crucial need for quick and reliable access to this life-saving medication, set out to create a solution. The result is CaseCaddy â€“ a meticulously designed, 3D-printed case that is as durable as it is stylish. Each CaseCaddy is crafted with precision and care, ensuring that your AuviQ is always within reach, without the bulk or hassle of traditional carrying methods. Join us in our commitment to safety and convenience. A CaseCaddy isn't just a case; it's peace of mind, always by your side.</p>
